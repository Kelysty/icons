# TODO

On this very moment all SVGs and React Icons had been created manually.
Even though it should've been created automatically (from Figma or
from uploaded SVG images).

- create `scripts/` folder
- attach `figma` if needed
- create `metadata.json`
- attach `Storybook`

learn from this [repo](https://github.com/gravity-ui/icons)
